/* Real time application program taken from the Chat-GPT.
       Write a C program for a shopping application that calculates the total cost of items purchased by a customer. 
The application should apply a discount based on the total cost of items purchased. The discount rules are as follows:

If the total cost is greater than or equal to $1000, apply a 15% discount.
If the total cost is between $500 and $999.99, apply a 10% discount.
If the total cost is less than $500, no discount is applied.
Your program should perform the following tasks:

--->Prompt the user to enter the total cost of items purchased.
--->Calculate the total cost after applying the discount based on the provided rules.
--->Display the original total cost, the discount amount (if any), and the final total cost to the user.

coding:

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
    int cost,discount,i;
    float disc;
    printf("Enter the total cost of the item : ");
    scanf("%d",&cost);
    if(cost<500)
    {
        printf("\n Discount is not applied to the item");
    }
    else if(cost>=500 && cost<1000)
    {
        printf("\n The discount is applied for the product");
        disc=cost*0.1;
        i=cost-disc;
        printf("\nThe discounted amount :%f",disc);
        printf("\n The amount after discount %d",i);    }
    else if(cost>=1000)
    {
        printf("\n The discount is applied for the product");
        disc=(cost*15)/100;
        i=cost-disc;
        printf("\nThe discounted amount :%f",disc);
        printf("\nThe amount after discount %d",i);
    }
}
