/*This is the real time Example which taken from the Chat-GPT and coded*/

Write a C program that simulates a temperature monitoring system for a greenhouse. The program should prompt the user to input the current temperature inside the greenhouse.
Based on the temperature entered, the program should provide feedback to the user about the greenhouse conditions using if statements.

Your program should perform the following tasks:

Prompt the user to enter the current temperature inside the greenhouse.
Read the temperature input from the user.
Use if statements to determine the greenhouse conditions based on the temperature entered:
If the temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius, print a message indicating that it's too cold for most plants.
If the temperature is between 10 and 25 degrees Celsius (inclusive), print a message indicating that the conditions are suitable for most plants.
If the temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius, print a message indicating that it's too hot for most plants. */

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
    int temp;
    printf("\n Enter the current temperature in the green house in Celsius:");
    scanf("%d",&temp);
    if(temp<10)
    {
        printf("It's too cold for most plants");
    }
    if(temp>10 && temp<25)
    {
        printf(" The conditions are suitable for most plants");
    }
    if(temp>25)
    {
        printf("It's too hot for most plants");
    }
}
